    <h1 class="main-header">How to travel</h1>
    <hr>

    <p class="msg" id="message">One of the most daunting things can be figuring out how to travel. Many people from America are used to only driving in their own car, and sometimes taking a taxi, or Uber, somewhere. So it can be hard to figure out how best to travel in a foreign land. Trying to navigate the many forms of public transportation can be tricky, also just figuring out how best to travel from country to country. Here, I'll help you figure out what form of travel is best for you, and help give you the tools to travel around Europe, and especially Ukraine.</p>

            <h2>Planes</h2>
            <p>Planes are a good form of travel if you need to go a long distance quick. Most planes in Europe are fairly small planes, so don't expect very comfortable seats or high quality service. You'll spend more time in the airport going through security, getting to your gate, and waiting to board the plane than you will on the plan itself. This type of transport is best for business, if you need to go to another country and back as fast as possible.</p>

            <h2>Trains</h2>
            <p>Trains are generally the most comfortable mode of transportation in Europe. On some trains, you'll be sitting in seats. Although, in other trains, you'll get a little compartment with a few small beds (smaller than a twin bed), and usually a small table. Usually, your door can lock, and you can enjoy your privacy to relax, take a nap, or watch a movie on your laptop without headphones.</p>

            <h2>Buses</h2>
            <p>Buses are best if you're trying to save money. Depending on the bus, you might be fairly comfortable, although most buses don't give you much leg and arm room. Riding a bus will take about as long as a train, but it's usually not nearly as comfortable. However, this is usually the cheapest way to get from country to country.</p>
