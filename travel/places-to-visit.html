    <p class="msg" id="message">There's something for everyone in Europe, and Ukraine specifically. For those that like the arts, there is some beautiful architecture, and many amazing museums. There is so much rich history there, and you can really go from any angle, either diving into all the history, and learning so much about the culture, or simply learning a little about the country, and seeing some amazing things from their history. For the more adventurous, there are many castles throughout Europe, and Ukraine specifically, that you can either walk around, or often climb around. There truly is an incredible variety of things to do there.</p>

            <h2>Kosice, Slovakia</h2>
            <p>Kosice is a nice little town, if you have a day or two to spend. There isn't much to do, although the city center is quite pretty. The main thing to see in this city is the Old Town. Here, there's the Cathedral of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, which is an incredibly beautiful cathedral.</p>
