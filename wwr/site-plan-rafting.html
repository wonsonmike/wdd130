    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My purpose for this website is to help share information about my rafting company. I want more people to know about us, and be excited by the opportunities we can provide. I think that we have one of the strongest rafting companies in the area, and I hope this website can help spread our reach even further. I love what I do, rafting is a life long passion of mine, and I want to share it with everyone!</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience is mostly young adults, and families without young kids. Our audience wants to have a fun time, and bond with the people they come with. We can't guarantee that they'll grow a lasting passion, like I have, but we can provide an exciting adventure for a short time. It's a great venue for events like birthdays and bachelor parties. Since we're targeting a younger audience, our site needs to be mobile compatible, but also have a good desktop experience.</p>
